A: Yes, you can return products due to change of mind within the applicable return period (14 days for new products). However, a 10% restocking fee (up to 1,000 EGP maximum) will be deducted from your refund. The product must meet all eligibility criteria: unused condition, original packaging intact, all accessories included, and serial number matching the invoice. Additionally, return shipping costs (50-200 EGP depending on location) will be deducted from your refund. If you prefer to avoid restocking fees, consider the exchange option or store credit with 5% bonus value.

**Q3: What products cannot be returned under any circumstances?**

A: The following products are non-returnable except for manufacturing defects covered by warranty: (1) Software and digital products with opened packages or activated licenses, (2) Personalized or custom-configured products, (3) Hygiene items like earphones and VR headsets after use, (4) Consumable products like batteries and ink cartridges after opening, (5) Clearance and final sale items marked "No Returns," and (6) Products with tampered serial numbers or broken warranty seals. Always check product descriptions before purchasing, as non-returnable items are clearly marked on our website and invoices.

**Q4: How do I initiate a return request?**

A: You can initiate a return through four convenient channels: (1) Online Portal - Log into your account at www.techmart-eg.com/returns, go to "My Orders," select the item, and click "Request Return" (recommended for fastest processing), (2) Phone - Call our customer service hotline at 16555, press option 2, and speak with a representative, (3) Email - Send a detailed request to returns@techmart-eg.com with your order number and reason for return, or (4) In-Store - Visit any TechMart retail location with the product and original invoice. You'll receive a Return Authorization (RA) number within 4-24 hours, which is required for all returns.

**Q5: How long does it take to receive my refund?**

A: The complete refund timeline is approximately 10-17 business days from initiating your return request. Here's the breakdown: Product inspection takes 2-3 business days after we receive your return, refund processing takes 5-7 business days after inspection approval, and the funds appear in your account within 5-7 business days for credit cards (depending on your card issuer) or 3-5 business days for Fawry payments. For cash-on-delivery orders, bank transfers take 7-10 business days, or you can opt for immediate store credit. To expedite the process, ensure your returned product meets all eligibility criteria and is properly packaged.

**Q6: Can I exchange a product instead of getting a refund?**

A: Absolutely. Product exchanges are encouraged and often faster than refunds. You have three exchange options: (1) Same Product Exchange - Exchange for an identical item at no extra cost if the original is defective, (2) Alternative Product Exchange - Choose a different product; if it costs more, you pay the difference; if less, you receive a refund or store credit for the difference, and (3) Store Credit Option - Receive 105% of your original purchase price as store credit (5% bonus), valid for 90 days. Exchange products are shipped within 2-3 business days after approval and arrive within our standard delivery timeframes (24-48 hours for Cairo/Giza, 3-5 days for other governorates).

**Q7: What if my product arrives damaged or defective?**

A: For damaged or defective products, take immediate action: (1) Document the damage by taking clear photos/videos before fully unpacking, (2) Contact customer service within 24 hours via phone (16555) or email (returns@techmart-eg.com), (3) Receive your RA number and return instructions, (4) We'll arrange free courier pickup within 24-48 hours (no shipping charges), and (5) After inspection confirms the defect or damage, receive a full refund or replacement with NO restocking fees. For items damaged during delivery, you may refuse acceptance and document the damage on the delivery receipt. Defective products are covered by our warranty policy even after the return period expires.

**Q8: What should I do if I lost my invoice or receipt?**

A: Don't worry. We can locate your purchase through our system using alternative information: (1) Order confirmation number (sent via email/SMS after purchase), (2) Transaction date and payment method used, (3) Registered phone number or email address, (4) Product serial number, or (5) Credit card last 4 digits used for purchase. Contact customer service at 16555 or returns@techmart-eg.com with any of this information, and we can retrieve your purchase record. For future reference, we recommend creating a TechMart online account where all your purchase history is automatically saved and accessible anytime.

**Q9: Can someone else return the product on my behalf?**

A: Yes, returns can be processed by an authorized representative. The representative must provide: (1) Original invoice with your name, (2) Written authorization letter from you (the original purchaser) including your signature and copy of your ID, (3) Representative's valid government-issued ID, and (4) The product with all accessories and packaging. For added security, we may call you at the registered phone number to verbally confirm authorization. This policy protects against unauthorized returns. Alternatively, you can use our convenient courier pickup service where you don't need to send a representative.

**Q10: What happens if I return a product that's missing accessories?**

A: Returns with missing accessories are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For non-essential accessories (such as user manuals that can be downloaded, basic USB cables), a 5-10% deduction or the replacement cost of the missing accessory (whichever is lower) will be applied to your refund. For essential accessories (such as remote controls, power adapters, specialized cables), the return may be rejected, or a deduction equal to the retail cost of the accessory will be applied (which can be 10-20% of product price). Alternatively, you can source and return the missing accessory before submitting your return to avoid deductions.

**Q11: Can I return a gift I received from someone else?**

A: Yes, gift recipients can return or exchange products. If you have the original invoice, follow the standard return process. If you don't have the invoice, you'll need: (1) The gift giver to provide the order number and authorization, or (2) Any TechMart security tags, labels, or packaging that help us verify the purchase in our system. Gift returns without invoice are issued as store credit only (not refunded to the original payment method). Exchange for a different product is available. The gift giver's payment method is never refunded directly to gift recipients for security reasons. Store credit is valid for 90 days and can be used for any TechMart products.

**Q12: What if I ordered the wrong product by mistake?**

A: If you ordered the wrong product due to your own selection error (not due to incorrect information on our website), this is considered a "change of mind" return. You may return the product within 14 days subject to a 10% restocking fee and return shipping charges, provided the product is unused and in original packaging with all accessories. To avoid these fees, consider: (1) Exchanging for the correct product instead (only pay the price difference if applicable), (2) Opting for store credit with 5% bonus (105% of purchase price), or (3) If you haven't received the product yet, contact us immediately at 16555 to modify or cancel your order before shipment (cancellation fee: 5% if order already shipped).
